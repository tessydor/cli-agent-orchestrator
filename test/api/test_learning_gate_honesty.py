"""The learning gate must not report a filesystem fault as a configuration choice.

``is_learning_enabled()`` fails closed, which is correct. But an unreadable
settings.json also resolves to False, so ``/outcomes`` answered 404 — "learning is
disabled" — for what was a permissions problem, and the MCP tools relayed that to
agents as a ``disabled`` payload they are told to skip silently. 503 says "I
cannot tell", which is what an operator needs to hear.

``_require_memory_enabled`` deliberately has no 503 branch: memory fails OPEN, so
an unreadable file there resolves to enabled and cannot mislead.
