# Statuses that represent a stable "ready" state — the agent has finished
# producing output and is waiting for further input. Once latched, the
# StatusMonitor will not regress to PROCESSING until ``notify_input_sent``
# is called (signalling that a new processing cycle is starting).
#
# Why: the event-driven pipeline derives status from a rolling state buffer,
# and TUI redraws (cursor positioning, status-bar refreshes) routinely
# evict the idle/response markers that the per-provider get_status() relies
# on. That makes status flap rapidly between IDLE/COMPLETED and PROCESSING
# in the seconds following completion. Without stickiness, both
# wait_until_status (server-side) and the e2e tests' HTTP polling miss the
# brief "ready" windows and time out (PR #273 codex 60s init timeouts,
# completion-timeout failures).

# Stale-PROCESSING self-heal (#558). get_status()'s cheap re-check re-derives from the SAME
# rolling buffer the FIFO pipeline feeds — and the moment a process goes genuinely idle it also
# stops emitting output, so that buffer stops changing. If its final content never happened to
# parse as a ready state (the idle marker rotated out of the bounded window, or a truncated
# escape corrupted the tail), re-running detection on the unchanging buffer returns
# PROCESSING/UNKNOWN forever: the pane already shows the finished response while every poller
# sees PROCESSING. The #397 pipe-liveness watchdog cannot see this either — the FIFO delivered
# its bytes, so the pipe looks healthy. Observed live: a queued message sat undelivered for
# ~10 minutes until a manual tmux resize forced a redraw. The self-heal reads the pane directly
# via get_backend().get_history() (a real ``tmux capture-pane``, NOT the FIFO-fed buffer — tmux
# always holds the current rendered state regardless of output volume) and re-detects from that.
# This constant rate-limits those reads: get_status() is a hot path (every wait_until_status
# poll, every UI refresh, fleet-wide) and a capture-pane is a real subprocess fork — unbounded,
# it would recreate the fork-storm class run()'s own docstring documents.
STALE_PROCESSING_CAPTURE_INTERVAL_S = 3.0

# The interval above bounds how OFTEN the fallback re-runs; this gates WHETHER it runs at all.
# Without it, every genuinely busy terminal would eat a capture-pane subprocess every ~3s for
# the entire duration of every ordinary turn, on top of the fifo watchdog's own probing. The
# wedge's actual signature is "the rolling buffer stopped changing", so require exactly that:
# only attempt a capture once no new chunk has been appended for this long. A terminal
# mid-burst never reaches the fallback at all.
STALE_PROCESSING_BUFFER_QUIET_S = 3.0

# A ready verdict from a single capture is never honored on its own — it must repeat on the
# next eligible read (see _fresh_capture_pane_status). This bounds how far apart those two
# reads may be: a candidate older than this is dropped and confirmation starts over. Without
# the bound, a candidate recorded during one turn could sit in the map indefinitely and be
# "confirmed" by one lone mid-repaint frame much later — exactly the single-frame latch the
# two-read confirm exists to prevent.

    ) -> Optional[TerminalStatus]:
        """Re-detect a stuck-PROCESSING terminal from a fresh pane capture (#558).

        ``generation`` is the turn/output generation the caller pinned BEFORE
        deciding to capture. The pane read below runs unlocked, so
        notify_input_sent or _process_chunk can bump the generation (and clear the
        candidate map) while it is in flight; a verdict from such a read describes
        the pane from BEFORE that boundary. The caller's apply-time check cannot
        see this alone: it only rejects CONFIRMED verdicts, while a straddling
        first read would re-seed the candidate map AFTER the boundary cleared it,
        and the next poll — pinning the new, by-then-stable generation — would
        treat that pre-boundary entry as its matching first read and confirm it.
        So every candidate-map mutation here (seed, confirm-pop, busy-pop) is
        performed only if ``generation`` is still current under the lock.

        Reads the pane directly via ``get_backend().get_history()`` (a real ``tmux
        capture-pane``, not the FIFO-fed rolling buffer) and re-runs provider detection
        against it. tmux always holds the correct, current rendered pane state regardless
        of output volume, so this can see the ready state a stale buffer cannot.

        Detector routing: a capture-pane snapshot is RENDERED content — cursor moves
        resolved, lines in on-screen order — a different input shape from the raw byte
        stream most ``get_status()`` detectors are tuned against (see BaseProvider.
        get_status's input contract). Feeding a rendered frame to a raw-stream detector
        produces systematic misreads, not noise: in a rendered busy kiro frame the
        always-drawn composer placeholder sits physically BELOW the working line and the
        credits line, which its raw-stream ordering checks parse as COMPLETED — and a
        deterministic misread sails straight through the two-read confirm below, because
        both reads see the same bytes. Applied, that false ready sticky-latches, disarms
        _allow_processing_revert, and blocks the agent's genuine PROCESSING for the rest
        of the turn. So the capture is routed through the two existing opt-in predicates:
        ``supports_screen_detection`` providers get their purpose-built
        ``get_status_from_screen()`` (calibrated for exactly this composited-viewport
        shape), ``supports_direct_status_probe`` providers get ``get_status()`` (declared
        safe on rendered snapshots — the same contract terminal_service's deferred-init
        direct probe relies on), and providers with neither flag fail CLOSED: no capture,
        no verdict, the terminal stays PROCESSING until the pipeline resolves it.
        The read is viewport-only (``visible_only=True`` — capture-pane ``-S 0``): a
        ``tail_lines`` read would include scrollback ABOVE the viewport, and detectors
        that match anywhere in their input (kimi/kiro ERROR indicators) would resurrect
        text from finished turns. Only the currently rendered screen is evidence.

        A single capture is still not trusted even on a routed detector: Ink-style TUIs
        repaint by clear-then-rewrite, and a sample caught between those two steps can
        miss the spinner while the previous response box parses ready. The screen path
        never samples mid-burst for exactly this reason (_schedule_screen_detection);
        since this read fires at an arbitrary moment instead, it requires the SAME ready
        status on two consecutive reads — the confirming read arriving within
        STALE_PROCESSING_CONFIRM_TTL_S — before honoring it. The same confirm-don't-trust
        pattern claude_code's wait_until_input_ready uses. The confirm still earns its
        keep despite the quiet gate: the gate watches the FIFO-fed buffer, so a pane that
        repaints without reaching the wedged FIFO can differ between reads.

        Returns ``None`` when skipped (rate-limited, no provider, unroutable detector,
        unconfirmed candidate, or any read/detection failure) — the caller treats that
        identically to "still PROCESSING", never as a signal to change status. Only ever
        called when cached status is already PROCESSING, so every failure path degrades
        to today's behavior, never past it.
